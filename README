This repository simply holds the MATLAB file for presenting images in a 
2-alternative forced-choice random draw task.

This is a task in which participants are asked two choose between two gumball machines 
with different probabilities of yielding a marble of a certain color.

It is part of my dissertation research on the psycho-physical properties of probability
judgments. 

You will need to download the Blender GUI to see the python code for creating and 
rendering the images. Please visit https://www.blender.org/ to learn more about Blender
